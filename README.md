A front-end for a Reddit-like page to share, comment and upvote posts.  

## Quickstart:

First, backend server should be running on `http://localhost:3001`. udacity-provivded server is available from `https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter`. `node server` starts the comment page backend.
`npm install` to get required packages.
`npm start` to start the React server in development mode and make the app viewable at `http://localhost:3000/`

### backend

The server backend does not save content to disk so on server startup there are two posts and two comments on the post titled 'Udacity is the best place to learn React'. 

### create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
